# Neutrium.pipe

The pipe module of the [Neutrium](https://neutrium.net) engineering library.

## Getting Started

### Installing

You can install NeutriumJS.Pipe using npm.

	npm install @neutrium/pipe --save

### Including

#### Typescript

You can include the NeutriumJS.Quantity module using an import statement in typescript:

    import {Pipe} from "@neutrium/pipe"

    let pipe = new Pipe();

This module is built with the declaration files so type hinting should work once the module has been imported.

#### Node

    var Pipe = require("@neutrium/pipe");

#### Browsers

The Pipe module is currently a commonjs (node) package. To use it in a browser environment you will need to use a tool like [browserify](http://browserify.org) to convert it to a web bunble and expose the Pipe object.
